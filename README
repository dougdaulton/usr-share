software to manage small libraries, coworking spaces, and community meet-up venues.

Hi there! /usr/share is a project spun off of http://usrlib.org/ and the general Downtown Project in Las Vegas.

Planned Features:

  * Catalog, manage and search book collections
  * Print labels and barcodes
  * Reserve meeting rooms on a calendar system
  * Event listings
  * Apply for membership and verify identity
  * Facebook and Twitter integration
  
It's still in a very early stage now. It was started on a plane to New Orleans for RubyConf 2011. 
When complete, we hope it will be a great option for small libraries and community projects like
co-working and hacker spaces to manage their membership and resources.
