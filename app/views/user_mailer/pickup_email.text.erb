Hi, <%= @user.name %>!

We're just writing to let you know that your /usr/lib access card is ready to pick up.

Just swing by The Beat Coffeehouse during business hours and let the barista know that
you are there to pick up a /usr/lib card. If you need to pay, they will be able to accept
payment in cash or credit card.

Quick reminder, the address is:

The Beat Coffee House
520 Fremont St, Ste 101
Las Vegas, NV 89101

After you've got your card, head up on to the second floor and take a running leap into
the bean bag (please make sure there is nobody already sitting in it first). You are now
a card carrying /usr/lib member. Welcome aboard and thanks for joining our community!

Sincerely,
Hal9000 and the /usr/lib team
